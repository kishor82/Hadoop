# User-Defined Functions
Pigâ€™s designers realized that the ability to plug in custom code is crucial for all but the
most trivial data processing jobs. For this reason, they made it easy to define and use
user-defined functions.

* This are kind of inaccurate results becouse we have both lowercase as well as uppercase latters like 
	
	* the	31738
	* The	2559

* So if we wanted to do count true we would need to first send everything to lowercase Just like we did it in our MapReduce job where we did in Java Same exact thing we need to do with pig latin.
* And Great way to do this is to do transform our data before we do our group and aggregation.
* Transform in way that we send everything to lowercase.
* We will make our "toLowecase" UDF(user define function)  in java and registered it with our pig latin script and then utilize it inside of our transformation.
